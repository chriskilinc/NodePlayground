## How To Use
```
git clone https://github.com/chriskilinc/NodePlayground
cd NodePlayground
npm install
npm start
```

## What Is This?
This is my Node.js boilerplate!  
I use this project to:
+ Reuse as a Template for future projects
+ Store my learning progress
+ Share code to other users
+ Retrieve feedback for refactoring purposes
+ Play around with new JavaScript functionality

## Under The Hood
  
All code is written in /src  
When running `npm start`, node runs `node src/index.js`
